# sd-webui-session-organizer
This extension lets you organize your generation outputs into separate session folders. For example, if you're generating a lot of inpainting images, this lets them stay in their own subdirectory instead of cluttering up your `img2img-images` output directory.

## Usage
Simply write the session name you want to use in the `Session Organizer` UI and your outputs will be moved there for you, under the `sessions` folder. A blank textbox means the default output directory will be used instead.
